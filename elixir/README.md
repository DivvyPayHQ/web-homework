# Homework

You will need to have postgres running.
The easiest way to install postgres is through brew:
`brew install postgres`

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) from your browser.
You can use [`localhost:8000/graphiql`](http://localhost:8000/graphiql) to make basic graphql queries from your browser.
