Hello Divvy Team!

Please review my Engineering Exercise submission.

This has been a lot of fun. I put a lot of time into this exercise but not all of it
is represented by the code base. 

 * Until this exercise, I had not written any elixir in close to a year. That
   meant I had to set up my environment and reacquaint myself with elixir and 
   phoenix. I needed to do this and only regret not doing it sooner. It feels
   good to be back in the saddle.
   
 * While I've done a reasonable amount of api work, I've actually not written
   any graphql. I spent some time getting introduced to graphql and stumbled 
   through getting graphql working and tested in this exercise. I'm starting
   to get the hang of it and look forward to digging deeper.
   
I think (hope) I've done what is needed to get to the next step in the hiring 
process. Here are some things I wish I had time to do:

 * expose the fuzzy name searching via graphql
 * move User into the new Accounts context
 * use ExMachina in all the tests, replacing the other scaffolding
 * finish all the objectives!

One of the bonus objectives was to find the security issue: One security issue
is that there is no authentication required...

I through in a few things that I find valuable in a phoenix project:

 * tids (test ids) in tables
 * ExMachina

I did this as a demonstration. I don't have to work this way. I think it is more
important for a team to have norms and apply those norms as consistently as  
possible. When the norms change, ideally apply those new norms to the
whole code base. 

Thank you for considering me.
