- A budgeting app.

## Setup
- First, make sure you have MongoDB running in the background.
- Then do the following commands:
```bash 
    cd webapp/
    yarn
    
    cd webserver/
    yarn
```

## To Run
- In both the webapp and webserver folders run:
```bash 
  yarn start
```
- This will get the client and the server app running.

And thats it! You can see the app on http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
