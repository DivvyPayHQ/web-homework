# Divvy Homework Assignment

### Chad Jemmett Divvy Homework Project

Greetings Divvy Devs. 
I have completed the homework in the application process to a Backend Developer Position at Divvy.
This is a strong example of the work you can expect from me when I start at Divvy. You will give me a project, I will
read and understand the documentation. Then I will implement the feature. 
I work idependently, but I always know when to ask the right questions about the process and I enjoy collaboration and code
reviews.

Please review the following two projects.


The first is in this repository. It demonstrates my abilities in Elixir, Ecto and Phoenix.
The second is here: [It is a demonstration of my ability to write an api in
Python.](https://github.com/ceejaay/transaction_tracker)

Please visit my other repository to review the project. It is an example of the kind of work I do at my current job.

### My work in this Elixir project. 
I made two accomplishments on this project.

1. I wrote a python script to seed the database.
2. I created the components of a new `Company` model.

The python script to seed the database is here: [Seed File.](https://github.com/ceejaay/web-homework/blob/master/seed.py)
At first I researched how to seed the database with the existing `seed` file included in the Homework app. I found the
learning curve to be steep, so I accomplished the task with the tools I am most familiar with. I used python and a
couple of libraries to seed the Postgres database.
You can read instructions to run the seed in the `seed.py` file.

For the `Company` model. I researched the Ecto documentation on their website. First I generated a context for the
Company model. I then manually created the relation among the `Company`, `User`, and `Transaction`.
I created the shchema and resolvers for the model.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your feedback on my work in our future interview. 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can talk about my work.

*************************************************************************************************
This repository provides a starting point for a basic React + GraphQL application.
All of the configuration boilerplate is complete so you can start by writing the code that you want us to see.

Please **fork** this repo a **private repo** on your GitHub account.

Please share your finished project repo with @thawk55 and @jakerichan as part of your submission.

<br />


## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/webapp`) and two server directories (eg `/webserver` and `/elixir`).

The `/webserver` one includes a functional GraphQL server in NodeJS with MongoDB backing it.

The `/elixir` one includes a functional GraphQL server in Elixir with Postgresql backing it.

If you are applying for backend, you should use the elixir code.
If you are applying for frontend, feel free to use either.

This project is _intentionally not utilizing 3rd party services or create-react-app_ to give you the opportunity to showcase your talents wherever they are, be it the front end or the back end.

## Instructions

If you are pursuing a full stack or backend position, please include elixir code changes in your homework.

See the [Frontend instructions](webapp/README.md) for frontend focused instructions.  If front end only, use the node server in `/webserver`.

See the [Backend instructions](backend.md) for backend focused instructions.
