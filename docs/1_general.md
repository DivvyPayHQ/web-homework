# My general thoughts on approaching projects

Recently, it has been useful to have a project lifecycle for consistency and tracking things. At a high level I think there are 4 steps that are useful. These are generally for larger proejcts where the requirements of this take home test might fit into a larger context.

  1. Have a product requirement spec document written
    a. this should outline the business goals of the project. what does success look like. specify what is being delivered and what isn't going to be delivered. optionally break this up into stages of delivery
  2. After the product requirements are defined, perform some engineering planning
    a. do planning before something new. this could be getting together and whiteboarding or just talking through the approach
    b. write down the plan in a short document. define clear milestones of for delivery.
    c. share document for review and approval
  3. start executing on the project
  4. follow up and clean up after shipping

I'm going to try and follow a similar process to this (mostly step 2) for each of features requested just to share my thoughts as much as possible in the interview experience.
