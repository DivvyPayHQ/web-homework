# Objectives

## 1. Write a basic user inerface that allows users to enter, edit, and remove transactions.

I again tried to map a pattern throughout the entire front end that helps with organization, code clarity and
allows for a modular approach when adding new components.

The end result is fairly vanilla and if I hadn't already invested so many hours into this code sample I would have liked to take the approach of using sockets for real time updates. Something that I am familiar with, but time wise I feel exceeds the scope of this project.

You are able to query for a list of Companies, Merchants, Transactions as well as edit or delete each one individually.

## 2. Add a user experience that showcases your abilities on the front end such as:

Better navigation was accomplished, but again more of a pattern to build off going forward.

Improved styling with the use of react-styled-components, but I will admit I am not a good designer. I can make anything happen though once you get me designs :wink:

Nested views was sort of accomplished with the use of react modals when adding/editing/deleting

Multiple routes with content was touched on as well when adding/editing/deleting
